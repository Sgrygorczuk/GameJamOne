# Paws Vs Dummy PBC Game Jam One#

PBC Game Jam  April 25-26 2020, Theme: Drama

The idea behind this game was to recreate the battle system from the Monster Rancher games. The system works on in a semi-active battle where the characters have to wait for their stamina to build up before using ant attack and their attack choice is based on standing in reference to their opponent. 

How does this relate to drama, dictionary defines drama as conflict which can be done in sense of absurd comedy. So we have our wanna be hero Paws trying to be the strongest fighter in the world being beaten up by a training dummy. 

I don't want to mess with the project much further just to preserve mt effort from my first game jam but may use the mechanics here something bigger in the future. If you want to check out it on itch.io at https://massamunee.itch.io/paws-vs-dummy.

What I wished I had added if given enough time: A fully able second characters (I wanted to make the dummy grow arms and legs and become an actual opponent when you have two players), have a second or even third set of attacks for both characters with abilities to push back and pull forward their opponents, give buff or stun and etc.  Over all better visuals, kind of had to half hearty draw quick frames of object to have something showing up.  And little things like the attacks lighting up and dimming when the user has enough stamina to use them, name of the attack and user being displayed.
